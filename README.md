# Java
The purpose of applications is to solve problems and simplify tasks for users and businesses. This project offers a solution for collecting and storing data in a database, utilizing various Java libraries such as JavaFX, Java.sql, and Java.util.ArrayList.

The project uses JavaFX to create a user interface and turn the design into an interactive prototype. It also closes the gap between designers and developers by creating a user interface that can be directly used in the JavaFX application. 

The Java.sql library provides the API for accessing and processing data stored in the relational database using the JavaTM programming language. This API includes a framework whereby different drivers can be installed dynamically to access the database. 

Finally, this task uses the Java.util.ArrayList class as well for its capability of creating resizable-array implementations of the List interface. It implements all optional list operations and permits all elements, including null. In addition to implementing the List interface, this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the list.
